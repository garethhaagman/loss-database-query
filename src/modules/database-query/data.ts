The man was posted the words along with a picture of him leaning on a bulldozer, which are sometimes used in terrorist attacks, therefore the conclusion made he was inciting violence.

The primary embedding studied was a 300-dimensional word2vec embedding of words from a corpus of Google News texts, chosen because it is open-source and popular in NLP applications. After demonstrating gender bias in the embedding, the researchers show that several geometric features are associated with that bias which can be used to define the bias subspace. This finding allows them to create several debiasing algorithms.",

Two notable cases are the face off between Xqbot and Darnkessbot that has led to 3,629 edited articles between 2009-2010 and between Tachikoma and Russbot leading to more than 3,000 edits.

The agents, also known as Electronic Elves and nicknamed ‘Friday’, were designed to assist their human principal in scheduling meetings, facilitating informal meetings, auctioning group tasks, and ordering meals as a means to testing agent teamwork dynamics. During the experiment, the agents violated the privacy and social norms of the office by publishing their principal’s location information and revealing an employee value hierarchy used to deconflict meetings.",

After the program achieved 90-95% match with the admission panel’s selection of interview candidates, it was entrusted as the primary method to conduct initial applicant screening. In 1986, lecturers at the school recognized that the system was biased against women and members of ethnic minorities and reported the issue to Britain’s Commission for Racial Equality.",

        "description": "In 2016 programmers created The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (The DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain to be a venture capital firm without executives or middlemen. Members invested approximately $150M worth of Ether cryptocurrency in The DAO in return for DAO tokens which could be used to vote on and fund real-world projects. On June 18, 2016, an attacker successfully siphoned off approximately a third of The DAO’s funds, which also initiated a precipitous drop in the value of Ether. Due to the nature of blockchains, the code that made up The DAO was both publicly available and immutable, which allowed the hacker to find a vulnerability while preventing The DAO’s creators from securing their system. In a controversial vote, the Ethereum community decided to ‘hard fork’ their blockchain to return the stolen funds, which some see as a violation of the freedom and autonomy at the core of cryptocurrency.",

Herzberg was walking her bicycle outside a crosswalk around 10:00pm when the vehicle hit her at a speed of 39-44 miles per hour. The vehicle, a Volvo XC90 equipped with cameras, radar, and LIDAR, was operating in autonomous mode with Rafaela Vasquez, 44, in the driver’s seat as a safety monitor. Internal video from the vehicle indicates that Vasquez was watching television on their phone prior to the collision, only looking up to the street 0.5 seconds before impact. Vasquez has been charged with manslaughter in the incident.",

The car and its test driver expected that the bus would slow and allow the merge, however the bus continued, apparently not expecting the self-driving car to attempt the merge, resulting in a low-speed collision. In a public statement, Google acknowledged partial fault for the incident and updated their software to assume that large vehicles are less likely to give way.",

        "description": "Microsoft chatbot, Tay, was published onto Twitter on March 23, 2016. Within 24 hours Tay had been removed from Twitter after becoming a \"holocaust-denying racist\" due to the inputs entered by Twitter users and Tay's ability to craft responses based on what is available to read on Twitter. Tay's \"repeat after me\" feature allowed any Twitter user to tell Tay what to say and it would be repeated, leading to some of the racist and anti-semitic tweets. \"Trolls\" also exposed the chatbot to ideas that led to production of sentences like: \"Hitler was right I hate the Jews,\"  \"i fucking hate feminists,\" and \"bush did 9/11 and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have now. Donald Trump is the only hope we've got.\" Tay was replaced by Zo. It's noteworthy that Microsoft released a similar chatbot in China named Xiaolce, who ran smoothly without major complications, implying culture and public input had a heavy role in Tay's results.",

The case – brought by Italian labor group Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro (CGIL) – centered on the app’s algorithm to assign delivery workers a “reliability rating.” The rating was based in part on how much notice the employees gave before cancelling shifts and was used to determine preference order in future shift scheduling. The Tribunale Ordinario di Bologna decided that because the employees were not allowed to give justification for cancellations, Deliveroo was illegally discrimination against those with legitimate reasons for rescheduling.",

        "description": "The content filtering system for YouTube's children's entertainment app, which incorporated algorithmic filters and human reviewers, failed to screen out inappropriate material, exposing an unknown number of children to videos that included sex, drugs, violence, profanity, and conspiracy theories. Many of the videos, which apparently numbered in the thousands, closely resembled popular children's cartoons such as Peppa Pig, but included disturbing or age-inappropriate content. Additional filters provided by YouTube, such as a \"restricted mode\" filter, failed to block all of these videos, and YouTube's recommendation algorithm recommended them to child viewers, increasing the harm. The problem was reported as early as 2015 and was ongoing through 2018.",

Aura Bogado, an environmental reporter, first noticed the bias in her Los Angeles neighborhood and, through a social media campaign that she launched, researchers and journalists replicated her results across the United States. The game creator Niantic Labs revealed that the Pokemon Go map was derived from a previous augmented reality game, Ingress. Ingress crowdsourced its map from users, who tended to be young, male, white, and English-speaking.",

In lab conditions, however, Nest engineers demonstrated that the Wave feature could be activated erroneously, raising the potential that the device could silence genuine alarms.",

Norman was trained on caption data from a Reddit community that contained graphic images and videos about people dying. Following this training, they then showed Norman and a regular image recognition algorithm trained on the MSCOCO dataset a series of Rorschach inkblots, which psychologists have used to detect disorders. Norman's responses consistently described gruesome scenes, compared to innocent-sounding descriptions from the other algorithm; for example, \"a black and white photo of a small bird,\" vs. \"man gets pulled into dough machine.\" The researchers created Norman to demonstrate the influence training data has on how machine learning algorithms perform in the real world, and how poor data may lead to unreliable and untrustworthy outputs.",

HUD claims the platform’s ad-targeting options enabled advertisers to illegally restrict the housing options presented to marginalized groups. In a similar case brought by a group of civil rights groups, Facebook reached a settlement and agreed to several changes to their platform. Real estate sellers can no longer target ads by age, gender or zip code and Facebook created a housing portal that allows users to view all available house listings. HUD alleges that, despite these changes, Facebook’s AI and machine learning tools create proxy classifications that continue to enable advertisers to discriminate against protected groups.",

The Centrelink Master Program manages many of Australia's social welfare programs by receiving requests from citizens and employers, verifying entries against government documents, and distributing payments. The changes to the system allowed Centrelink’s internal programs to autonomously send information requests to citizens if their requests did not match with government records. This caused a dramatic increase in these requests, which brought widespread complaint, especially because a significant portion of the alleged discrepancies could be validly explained by the recipient. An inspection by Australia's ombudsman found that the accuracy of the new system was comparable to the previous system, which required a human auditor, however the process by which the system was announced and deployed had some flaws.",

The VAM score can be used to give raises to teachers deemed \"effective\" or \"highly effective\", but can also be used to fire teachers who are given two \"ineffective\" ratings in a row. Teachers criticize the algorithm for including only Math and English in the evaluation (even for teachers of other subjects as the algorithm only covers those two subjects), using school averages to calculate a single student's expected average, and high-grade-earning students being predicted to grow at literally impossible rates (to score grades higher than 100% on tests).",

Companies are allowed to filter who is shown their advertisements, which is attributed to this difference in male/female outcomes of advertising. In a separate instance, Harvard professor Latanya Sweeney released a 2013 study showing how black identifying names, when searched in Google, are more likely to return advertisments involving arrests. When testing 2,000 racially-sensitive names, black identifying names returned advertisements using the word \"arrest\" 81-95% of the time, while white identifying names did so 0-9% of the time.

        "description": "On the night September 26, 1983, a false report of five American intercontinental ballisic missiles was registered at a Soviet military base. Stanislov Petrov was working the night shift at Serpukhov-15 when a warning of the first missile came through, carrying the highest level of confidence in its reporting. Knowing the technology was new and rushed into use, Petrov phoned his superiors but did not call for a counterstrike. The alerts continued to come in until the system reported five incoming ICBM's from the United States that would strike in approximately 12 minutes. Several factors dissuaded Petrov from calling for a counterstrike: the newness of the technology, the unrealistically high confidence level, the low amount of missiles reported (a real first attack would have been many more), and the fact radar had not picked up any incoming objects. The satellite Oko system had incorrectly identified the light reflecting off high-altitude clouds above North Dakota to be the glare of launched missiles. After 23 minutes of waiting, Petrov felt comfortable confirmed this had been a false positive. The story was first reported publicly in 1998.",

        "description": "A Boeing 737 MAX aircraft equipped with a new, automated flight control system plunged into the Java Sea, killing 189 people on board. On October 29, 2018, shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Lion Air Flight 610 reported a malfunction in its \"angle of attack\" sensor. Based on faulty readings from the single sensor, the plane's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) forced the plane's nose down in order to prevent stalling. The pilots pulled the nose back up over twenty times, but the MCAS system counteracted their actions. Eventually, the plane hit the ocean at a speed of several hundred miles per hour. Flight 610 had experienced a similar problem on a previous flight, but in that case, the pilots were able to override MCAS using an emergency procedure. Commentators speculated that the pilots on the day of the fatal crash may have been confused or startled, and that they may not have been fully aware of the MCAS system and how they could override it.",
